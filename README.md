# alx-intermediate-frontend
This project focuses on building a solid foundation in Semantic HTML while emphasizing accessibility, SEO optimization, and the implementation of ARIA roles for enhanced usability. Through incremental tasks, a web page is structured and enhanced to make it not only visually structured but also optimized for screen readers and search engines. The project will lead to an understanding of the importance of semantic elements and accessibility features in modern web development.
